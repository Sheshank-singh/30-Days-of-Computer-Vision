# üß† 30 Days of Computer Vision Challenge

Welcome to my **30-day Computer Vision challenge**! This repository tracks my journey of learning and building projects using Python, OpenCV, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Each day features a new concept or real-world project with code and explanations.

---

## üöÄ Why this Challenge?

This challenge helps me:
- Build strong Computer Vision fundamentals
- Apply concepts in hands-on projects
- Explore powerful tools like **OpenCV**, **YOLO**, **AWS Rekognition**, and **Detectron2**
- Learn consistently and build a public portfolio
